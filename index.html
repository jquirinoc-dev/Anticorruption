        <p>
            We can define corruption as a form of dishonesty or a criminal offense which is undertaken 
            by a person or an organization which is entrusted in a position of authority, in order to 
            acquire illicit benefits or abuse power for one's personal gain.

                        Transparency International defines bribery as: the offering, promising, giving, 
                        accepting or soliciting of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is 
                        illegal, unethical or a breach of trust. Inducements can take the form of money, 
                        gifts, loans, fees, rewards or other advantages (taxes, services, donations, favours etc.).

                        This is a crime that consists of withholding assets for the purpose of conversion 
                        of such assets, by one or more persons to whom the assets were entrusted, either 
                        to be held or to be used for specific purposes. Embezzlement is a type of 
                        financial fraud.

                        Sometimes referred to as election manipulation, voter fraud or vote rigging, 
                        involves illegal interference with the process of an election, either by 
                        increasing the vote share of a favored candidate, depressing the vote share of 
                        rival candidates, or both.

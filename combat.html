            The Organization of American States was established in order to achieve among its member 
            states—as stipulated in Article 1 of the Charter—"an order of peace and justice, to promote 
            their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their 
            territorial integrity, and their independence."

            The UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) was adopted by the General Assembly through 
            resolution 58/4 in 2003 and entered into force in December 2005. It presents a comprehensive 
            set of standards, measures and rules that all state parties to the convention should apply to 
            strengthen their legal and regulatory regimes to fight corruption.

            The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA, the Act) is a United States law that prohibits U.S. 
            firms and individuals from paying bribes to foreign officials to further business deals.
            Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
            are responsible for enforcing the FCPA.

                Be aware that there are multiple types when it comes to corruption.
                IMCO’s Anticorruption Director Max Kaiser pointed out: “There is no way
                that this country can change if we believe that corruption is only about
                bribing a police officer. For a lot of Mexicans, that is the only type of corruption.”
